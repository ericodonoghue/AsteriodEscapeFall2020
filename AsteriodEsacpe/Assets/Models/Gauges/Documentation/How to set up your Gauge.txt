On TOP GAUGES MEGA PACK folder you will find: 

1. Documentation: You will find this file.
2. Material: All materials used on prefabs
3. Meshes: All meshes to start to create your gauge, basically they are divided by: 

a) Gauge-BG: Rounded, you can scale the height as you need.
b) Gauge-Cover: Top design, go over the gauge material, diferent models available. (Some has bevel borders and others just flat)
c) Gauge-Glass: Flat and Rounded.
d) Gauge-Material: Gauge designs, there are 2 models available, entire flat and Disc (with has a hole in the middle).
e) Gauge-Neon: Go along the Gauge-BG to accept emission materials.
f) Gauge-Pin: Variety of Pins to bring details
g) Gauge-Pointer: Variety of Pointers models. Scale it as you need.

TIP: All meshes has the same positions, just drag them all to the editor (reset all positions to 0,0,0) and start to adjust as you wish.
 
4. PostProcessing: Just to bring some effects to neon materials
5. Prefabs: 15 Prefabs to check how we build and start from them + 4 Compass prefabs as bonus
6. Scenes: There are 4 scenes in the pack:

a) Gauges: See all mesh models available
b) Demo: See how a prefab looks.
c) Dirty Glasss: See how a prefab looks using Dirty Glass material.
d) All Prefabs: Check them all at once.

LOD: To get most performance, there is 1 Prefab (LOD-LowPoly-Gauge) which is Low Poly to be used for far distances. 
     Duplicate and Rename this mesh as you need.
     PSD available in the folder (Zip Files > Gauges PSD) to easy create your materials for LODs.

7. Shaders: Simple shaders for the Gauge-BG (both sides) and Glasses.

a) Gauges PSD: PSD Mockup for Guages and Gauges Low Poly sample.
a) Compass PSD: PSD Mockup for Compass.

10. TopGearsMegaPackSample: A gear mesh to be used with Gauge-Material-Disc, cortesy of Top Gears Mega Pack 125+. (Also available on Marketplace)

See Demo scenes to have a better idea.

Tips: Mount the Gauge on a flat surface, use the same location 0,0,0 for all meshes till finish your gauge.

Note: In order to all effects and neon light work properly in your project you have to download and enable Post Processing on your camera.



<< ==== How to create a new Low Poly Gauge Material ==== >>

1. Open the file (Gauges-LowPoly-Albedo.psd) located in the folder (Zip Files > Gauges PSD)
2. There are 2 smart objects layers, Pointers and Gauge. Double Click on them to open the .psb with all layers, select one of the prefabs layers or create a new one and save.

Tip: Try to not change the masks (from Quixel project) and keep all the layers as smart object (do not RASTERIZE the layers) and export the new Gauge.
